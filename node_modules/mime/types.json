     * and a public type representing a safe to share subset of the properties of the internal state.

     * ```ts

     * interface MyOperationState extends PollOperationState<ResultType> {

     * interface PublicState extends PollOperationState<ResultType> {
     *   publicProperty?: string;
     * }
     *
     * // Then, we define our Poller as follows:
     * export class MyPoller extends Poller<MyOperationState, ResultType> {
     *   // ... More content is needed here ...
